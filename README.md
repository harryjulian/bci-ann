# Using Artificial Neural Networks to reverse-engineer the computational foundations of Multisensory Integration
Repo containing scripts to train neural networks on analogues of Multisensory Integration tasks and assess the extent to which network layers approximate Bayesian Causal Inference.

Experiments should be able to be replicated simply by cloning the repo.
